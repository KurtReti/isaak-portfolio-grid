                <div class="home-content-text">I am passionate about film and work in many different areas of the industry I focus on Assistant Directing, Directing and Director of Photography work. 

                    I live in Sydney but love to travel and film new locations and work where ever I am needed. I have worked on multiple Short Films and Documentaries. Film has been my dream since I was a child and working in the industry is a dream come true on its own but I hope one day to sit in a packed cinema watching my own film. I have been working tirelessly to improve my skills.</div>
